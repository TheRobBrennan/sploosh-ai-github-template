# Welcome

This is a GitHub template repository that provides automated versioning, GPG signing, and standardized workflows for Sploosh.AI projects.

It includes:

- Automated semantic versioning
- GPG signing for all commits
- Local GitHub Actions and Workflow testing with `act`
- Standardized PR and commit message formats

## Quick Start

If you plan on using the generate-gpg-key.sh script to generate a GPG key, temporarily replace the placeholder passphrase with a secure passphrase of your choice:

```sh
# TODO: Replace this with a secure passphrase of your choice
PASSPHRASE="d3f3nd!t@ll"
```

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Ensure your SSH agent is running and has the appropriate key added (example uses ~/.ssh/splooshai-github)
npm start
```

## Testing GitHub Actions Locally

We recommend using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test GitHub Actions workflows locally before pushing changes if you are developing on a Mac.

The application does not have to be running in Docker to test the workflows, but Docker Desktop must be running for the act tests to run and spin up the necessary containers.

Prerequisites for macOS

- Homebrew
- Docker Desktop (must be running)

```sh
# Install act using Homebrew
brew install act

# Verify installation
act --version # Should show 0.2.74 or higher

```

### Running Tests

The following test scripts are available:

1. `npm run test`
   - Primary test command
   - Runs all workflow tests via test:workflows
   - Recommended for general testing

2. `npm run test:workflows`
   - Runs all workflow tests in sequence
   - Tests PR title validation and version bumping
   - Provides detailed feedback

3. `npm run test:workflows:semantic`
   - Tests PR title validation only (using minor version example)
   - Validates against conventional commit format

4. `npm run test:workflows:semantic:major`
   - Tests PR title validation with breaking change
   - Validates major version bump detection

5. `npm run test:workflows:semantic:minor`
   - Tests PR title validation with new feature
   - Validates minor version bump detection

6. `npm run test:workflows:semantic:patch`
   - Tests PR title validation with bug fix
   - Validates patch version bump detection

7. `npm run test:workflows:semantic:invalid`
   - Tests PR title validation with invalid format
   - Verifies rejection of non-compliant PR titles

8. `npm run test:workflows:version`
   - Tests version bump workflow
   - Note: Git operations will fail locally (expected)

9. `npm run test:workflows:merge`
   - Tests main branch merge workflow
   - Simulates PR merge and version bump process
   - Note: Git operations will fail locally (expected)

#### Expected Test Results

1. Semantic PR Check Tests:
   - All tests should pass except "invalid" test
   - Invalid PR format test should fail with clear error

2. Version Bump Tests:
   - Will show git authentication errors (expected)
   - These workflows can only be fully tested in GitHub Actions

3. Merge Tests:
   - Will show authentication errors locally (expected)
   - Tests workflow syntax and merge logic
   - Full functionality requires GitHub Actions environment

## Development Guidelines

- **Version Control**: We use semantic versioning with automated version bumps
- **Commit Signing**: All commits must be GPG signed
- **Pull Requests**: PR titles must follow conventional commit format
